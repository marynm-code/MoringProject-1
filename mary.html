    <h3>Here are the 5 things people love about me</h3>
    <p>1. My courage. Think of all the hardships you’ve been through. How else do you think you got through the tough times? It certainly wasn’t because you got scared and buried your head in the sand. And yes, it certainly wasn’t fun to, say, go through
        unemployment or even a family loss, but think of how others looked up to you when you braved the stormy seas. Whether you realize it or not, you probably encouraged many others to become more courageous, just like you. Being courageous also means
        taking risks. Think that what you’ve done so far in life isn’t risky? Recall those times when you hopped on a plane to go on vacation to Thailand or other places where English isn’t the first language. Many people would be terrified to do something
        like that.
    </p>
    <p>2. My energy. You work harder and give your time to those you love a lot. Don’t even try to dispute that because you know it’s true! You’ve got so much enthusiasm that people feel more energetic just by being around you. The way you talk, the way
        you walk, it’s just so electrifying!
    </p>
